# SupaSnake.js | Project #1 in [Geaux Code 30 Projects](https://github.com/GeauxWeisbeck4/geaux-code-30-projects)

This version of Snake was built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite, and Supabase.

This app is a full-stack project that includes a backend that stores players scores and a frontend that allows you to play the original snake game and submit a high score if you are one of the ten highest recorded scores. This project was created for my 30 Days of Projects Blog Series on Dev.to and you can learn how to build it there.

## To Get Started

1. Create a new Supabase project. Make sure you grab your Supabase project key and URL and store it somewhere safe. You will put this in the .env file later on.
2. Git clone this repository to your local machine. CD into the repo and run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to get the dev mode running on your local machine.
3. Follow the rest of the instructions in the blog post to get your backend functional with the frontend so you can have your own version of Snake.js.

**These instructions are a work in progress as I work on the blog post.**
